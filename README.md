## Overview

SoftSell is a responsive, single-page React application that enables organizations to unlock value in idle or surplus software licenses through a secure, fast, and fair process. The site features a Hero banner with CTA, “How It Works” steps, “Why Choose Us” highlights, customer testimonials, a contact form with embedded Google Maps, and an AI-powered chat assistant.

## Features Implemented

- **Hero Section** – Custom headline, subheading, and “Get a Quote” CTA button.  
- **How It Works** – Three-step visual process (Upload → Valuation → Payment) using React-Feather icons.  
- **Why Choose Us** – Three benefit tiles with icons and brief descriptions.  
- **Customer Testimonials** – Two dummy reviews with name, role, and company, styled as cards.  
- **Contact Form** – Front-end validation for Name, Email, Company, License Type (dropdown), and Message fields; embedded Google Maps iframe.  
- **AI ChatBot** – Floating chat widget powered by Google Gemini (via `@google/genai`), with preset Q&A and fallback responses.  
- **Responsive Navbar** – Fixed-top navbar that transitions from transparent to colored on scroll.
- **Animations** – On-scroll reveals using AOS for fade, zoom, and flip effects.

## Design Choices

- **Color Palette** – Teal, green, and gray for a modern, trust-inspiring aesthetic; switches to dark neutrals in night mode.  
- **Typography** – “Poppins” for a clean, readable sans-serif look, with system-font fallbacks.  
- **Layout** – Bootstrap grid ensures mobile responsiveness; `.ratio` utility for responsive iframes.  
- **Iconography** – React-Feather icons for lightweight, consistent visuals.  
- **Transitions** – Subtle hover lifts on cards and smooth navbar color shifts to reinforce interactivity.
